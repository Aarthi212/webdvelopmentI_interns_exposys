                                            Tamil Nadu is famous for its magnificent stone temples. The
                                            giant butter ball of <i>Mahabalipuram</i>, the <i>Cholas</i> at
                                            <i>Thanjavur</i>, and
                                            the huge temple of Goddess <i>Meenakshi</i> in <i>Madurai</i>, to name a
                                            few. However, there is a less known fact about <i>Ayyanar</i>, as these
                                            gems are hidden away in remote villages. Across Tamil Nadu,
                                            terracotta is famous, but it is recognised more culturally and
                                            traditionally.

                                            Each village is guarded at the entrance by an enormous
                                            terracotta horse, the horse of Ayyanar. Ayannar is a folk God who
                                            rides a white horse and protects the villages from evil spirits,
                                            the gramdevta of the village and its protector against all evils.
                                            Ayyanar has an enormous moustache ,big teeth and wide open
                                            eyes. Veerans are the commanders who surround Ayyanar at the
                                            entrance. In Tamil Nadu, potters are known as Kuyavar, Kulalaar
                                            or Velar and they trace their origin to Vishwakarma, the divine
                                            craftsman himself.

                                            Ayyanar horses range from less than a meter to our 6 m in
                                            height. They are painstakingly made by mixing moist clay
                                            with straw and sand for a proper consistency. First the legs are
                                            made using four clay cylinders which are rolled out with a piece
                                            of wood. Then the body is built up gradually. After that, the
                                            accessories like bells, mirrors, grotesque faces (kirtimukha) and
                                            crocodiles (magar), are made separately as is the head. Then the
                                            parts are joined together on the auspicious 10th day, when the
                                            figure of Ayyanar is seated on the horse and given its features.
                                            This huge terracotta figure then is baked in a rustic kiln of straw
                                            and verati (dried cow dung) covered with mud. Some parts of
                                            the larger figures have to be filed separately, joined together and
                                            fired again. Sometimes the faces are painted red to denote anger
                                            and the neck is painted blue to denote calm The rest of the
                                            body is decorated in bright colours. The specialty of these horse
                                            is that their tail, their ears, the head and their four legs can be
                                            removed separately.
