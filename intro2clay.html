                                            <b>Clay</b> is basically a term
                                            used to describe malleable
                                            materials that can be used for
                                            modelling and creating 3
                                            dimensional objects.<br />
                                            Clay is created by the chemical
                                            weathering and geothermal
                                            alteration of igneous rocks into
                                            hydrous aluminium
                                            phyllosilicates. Most often the
                                            precursor rock is a type of
                                            granite. However, clay can also
                                            be made of synthetic materials,
                                            such as polymer.

                                            recognised in many economic

                                            Because the viscosity of oils

                                            Playdoughs are easily made at home in both cooked and uncooked versions, and
                                            are less expensive than some of the other types of clay. They are made of
                                            such ingredients as flour, cornstarch, cream of tartar, oil, and water. They

                                            Ceramics.

                                            Though the skills required to work with the clay are
                                            similar across most mediums, there are specific aspects
                                            which differentiate the two. The first being the actual
                                            chemical composition of the two clays. The white ceramic
                                            clay is made through the mix of china clay, ball clay and
                                            feldspar, which generally has to be mined and prepared
                                            separately in order to create the malleable clay substance.
                                            Whereas terracotta clay is present in its natural state in
                                            marshy areas. Due to this, the base texture of the clay
                                            differs as well. Ceramics, due to their components, have a
                                            chalkier and more powdery feel when dried, whereas the
                                            terracotta clay hardens without the powdery attributes.

                                            The final difference is the finish of the clay product.
                                            At the usual temperature terracotta is fired at, once
                                            completed, it creates a non-porous smooth surface on its
                                            products. Whereas the ceramic products possess unique
                                            qualities. Before firing, the product has to be manually
                                            sanded in order to get a smooth surface, to avoid the
                                            possibility of the development of sharp spikes on the
                                            surface. In addition to this, without the use of glaze,
                                            the product will still be porous and have a chalky water
                                            absorbent texture and nature. These are the primary
                                            differences in the production, process and finished product
                                            of both mediums.

                                            The main categories of clays in India are: Alluvial, Black, Red and

                                            South-India experiences a semi-arid tropical climate, so several types of
                                            clayey deposits like sedimentary, alluvial, and red and residual are seen
                                            here.
                                            These widespread superficial formations are among the most used raw
                                            materials, especially for road works and as construction materials. Alluvial
                                            clays
                                            have a strong bearing on the resultant thermal modifications during the
                                            firing stage of building bricks and tiles. In this region, there is a vast
                                            utilization of
                                            clays by the local population for both fired and unfired bricks, tiles and
                                            pottery. However, such exploitation is inefficient because no preliminary
                                            evaluation
                                            and testing have been carried out, despite the fact that is useful for all
                                            raw materials. From an industrial point of view, it is very important to
                                            evaluate the
                                            possibility of the use of alluvial and red clays in the production of bricks
                                            and tiles.

                                            In Tamilnadu, there are extensive clay deposits mainly alluvial and red
                                            clays. Clays from this region are widely used as raw materials for red
                                            bricks and
                                            roofing tiles by the local ceramic industry, which assembles more than 140
                                            plants. Despite the vast use of these clays, poor understanding of the
                                            chemical
                                            composition, particle size and mineralogy on properties of these clays have
                                            reduced the quality of the final products. Therefore, a proper study and
                                            understanding of these clay materials is essential to improve the quality
                                            and reduce the defects of the products thereby decreasing natural materials
                                            wastage and increasing the profit margins of the industry. So, particular
                                            attention should be given to the exploitation of raw materials in India for
                                            industrial
                                            application. Thus, the knowledge of these clays has both academic value and
                                            immediate commercial interest. This work is undertaken in order to assess
                                            the potential use of manufacturing construction ceramic products. For this
                                            purpose, the four clay materials are characterized with respect to their
                                            chemical,
                                            mineralogical and physical (particle size and plasticity) properties to
                                            evaluate their potential use of clays to manufacture structural products.
