                                            Terracotta is prevalent in history across so many genres because it can be
                                            found everywhere and is known as being the most commonly found clay across
                                            every continent. The earliest reference made to terracotta was in
                                            prehistoric
                                            art, with artefacts being found as far back as 24,000 BC. These early pieces
                                            were found to be Palaeolithic terracotta figurines, rather than cooking
                                            vessels.
                                            Paleolithic terracotta figures were fired in primitive kilns, created
                                            underneath
                                            open fires.

                                            The oldest recorded piece of terracotta in the world is the The Venus of
                                            Dolni Vestonice (c.26,000 BCE). With a height of approximately 4.5 inches
                                            and width of 1.7 inches it was discovered at a Stone Age settlement in
                                            the Moravian basin, near Brno, in the Czech Republic. It now resides in
                                            the Vienna Natural History Museum. It was baked in an earthen oven at
                                            nearly 700 degrees Celsius made from a combination of locally sourced clay
                                            and powdered bone. Famous terracotta figurines from the era of Neolithic
                                            art include: The Enthroned Goddess Figurine (c.6,000 BCE) from Catalhuyuk,

                                            found in Greece, and larger objects dating from the 7th century BCE were
                                            also found. The craft was carried to Etruria by Greek artists, which further
                                            evolved in Rome. In Greece, terracotta statuary was used extensively to
                                            decorate temples. The modelled Etruscan statues, at times very Greek in
                                            style
                                            but often more fierce, were admired widely in antiquity. Figures on Etruscan
                                            sarcophagi often were of terra-cotta. The findings of Roman Terracotta
                                            statues are scarce.

                                            Molded statuettes 6 to 7 inches (15 to 18 cm) in height are common
                                            throughout the ancient world. Cypriot figures often comprise groups of
                                            dancers or warriors, and the Cretan feature lively poses of women, horsemen,
                                            or animals. Post 7th century BCE, the subjects of the figures became
                                            more or less mundane, such as a nurse with child, a teacher and pupils,
                                            an actor in costume. The Tanagra figurines, found in Tanagra in central
                                            Greece, Boeotia, are the best known of this kind. In the Hellenistic period,
                                            from the 4th century BCE, centres of statuette production moved to Asia
                                            Minor and westward, being found throughout the Roman Empire as
                                            far as Britain. Styles in the East became more ornate and influenced by
                                            Oriental values in design and subject.

                                            The set of fired clay figures known as the Chinese Terracotta Army -
                                            made during the period of Qin Dynasty art (221-206 BCE) are one of
                                            the finest works ever created in the history of sculpture. Around 7000
                                            life- sized ceramic clay warriors were individually crafted, accompanied by
                                            generals and horses, equipped with real weapons, and installed in battle
                                            formation in three underground pits. These figures were unearthed in
                                            1974 adjacent to the tomb of the First Qin Emperor, Qin Shi Huangdi, in
                                            Shaanxi province, China. The figures were commissioned by the Emperor
                                            in 247 BCE. Work started in about 246 BCE and is estimated to have
                                            taken almost 40 years to complete, with a manpower of 700,000 workers.
                                            The role of the army was to serve the Emperor in the afterlife. The
                                            collapse of the Roman Empire (c.450) led to a dramatic decline in the use
                                            of terracotta. Early Renaissance helped in the revival of terracotta as an
                                            artistic medium. Renaissance sculptors, Donatello and Lorenzo Ghiberti
                                            rediscovered the ability of terracotta for creating images of Christian
                                            art, it was a discovery that came about through their close knowledge
                                            of bronze sculpture - the use of clay is central to the creation of bronze
                                            statues.

                                            sculptors have often used terracotta models when sending designs or making

                                            In short, terracotta was re-established by Renaissance sculpture as a major
                                            medium of artistic expression and innovation. The tradition was further
                                            developed by Bernini (1598-80) and Alessandro Algardi (1598-1654) during
                                            the era of Baroque sculpture, particularly in the area of relief sculptures

                                            portrait bust. Terracotta was explored for its decorative characteristics
                                            during
                                            the 18th century, while the great Antonio Canova (1757-1822) continued to
                                            use it for models, until he replaced it with plaster in the early 19th
                                            century.
