                                            Terracotta has made its mark from prehistoric ages and is one of the oldest
                                            art forms that are still prevalent in the modern era. It has been used by people
                                            across the globe for centuries.<br>From the magnificent terracotta army in China to the beautiful figurines
                                            found from the ruins of ancient Rome, it has played an essential role in the
                                            development of art through the ages. Traditionally, it is seen as a mystical
                                            material due to its combination of four of the five vital elements- air, Earth,
                                            fire and water.<br>Terracotta products have proven to be so well loved by people in both the
                                            past and the present. Today, terracotta is still used in pottery and art for the
                                            home and beyond. Its superior durability, vibrant colours , and easy to mould
                                            nature make it a popular choice for sculptors and architects. It is a surprisingly
                                            versatile material and can complement a wide range of interiors. The
                                            colour, in a contemporary setting is used to add warmth to the modern and
                                            monochromatic themes. On the other hand, in a traditional setting, terracotta

                                            The craft industry provides huge employment opportunities to artisans that
                                            include women and people belonging to backward and weaker society. India
                                            houses an estimate of about 6 million different artisans.

                                                Terracotta is also used as a color word, to denote
                                                the color of earth. As terracotta literally means baked
                                                earth the distinct color comes from the iron content
                                                in clay reacting with oxygen during firing, which
                                                creates the rich, earthy tone. The color itself has
                                                some variation, from more red tones, to pale orange,

                                        <b> Clay Cups </b>- The utility and advantage of terracotta as a medium can be seen prominently in its inclusion in industrial and commercial applications.
                                           A recent example of this is the large scale implementation of terracotta products to be put into use in the Indian railways. India has had a longstanding
                                           tradition of using earthen pots for a variety of uses but as of late, that has decreased significantly due to the use of plastic products, but these to have their
                                           drawbacks. Due to this the Indian railways have implemented the use of ‘Kulhads’, a small earthen cup. Kulhads are small earthen cups used to serve
                                           a number of traditional delicacies such as mishti doi , mallaiyo and tea. The cups are also used in a single use format, which perfectly suits the need in
                                           replacement of single use plastic cups which are in use as of now for the majority of drinks given out at railway stations, primarily tea. The cup itself is
                                           cheaper to produce compared to other materials, biodegradable and also inherently hygienic due to them being fired in a kiln. It is also known that the cups
                                           itself add an enhancement to the flavour of the beverage due to the earthly aroma imparted by the clay.<br><br>
                                           As of now roughly 400 railway stations are using this system with the plan to implement them nation wide to all 7000 stations, thereby massively cutting
                                           down on single use plastics. In addition to drastically reducing toxic plastic use there will also be large amounts of employment generated especially in the
                                           craft sector due to this project. The number is astronomically large, pre pandemic figures show India at roughly 23 million commuters by train per day.
                                           With estimations of employment for upto 2 million of the craft and pottery industry. Though it isn’t just smooth sailing for a venture like this, especially one
                                           of this size.<br>Firstly with the pottery itself, handmade pottery is never uniform, in its shape and size. And clay in different parts of the country are vastly diverse from one
                                           another, making it near impossible to standardise it like an industrial process. Coordinating artisans from across the country to work, and to gather as well
                                           is a mammoth task, also providing artisans with the required equipment and raw materials is difficult currently. Hopefully these difficulties will be navigated
                                           efficiently as a project such as this is massive benefit to everyone involved especially the artisans while also greatly combating the problem of pollution and
                                           single use plastics.
