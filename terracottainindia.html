                                                    Terracotta has a traditional value in India. It has been used for
                                                    centuries and has taken shape
                                                    over thousands and thousands of years. Terracotta uses the
                                                    combination of air, earth, fire and
                                                    water which are the five vital elements, thus is seen as a mystical
                                                    material. Terracotta is used
                                                    in the field of art and pottery. Due to its extensive background,
                                                    it’s no wonder that India has
                                                    some prominent when it comes to the usage of terracotta. Most
                                                    famously, the largest terracotta
                                                    sculpture ever made was the Ayyanar horse - created in Tamil Nadu.
                                                    What makes the end
                                                    product unique from region to region in India, is the difference in
                                                    clay type and colour, as well
                                                    as the sensibilities of the artist, varied culture, religious

                                                    Birbhaum, Digha, and Hooghly.
                                                    The art form came to this state in the 16th century with the
                                                    influence of Vaishnavite movement which found expression in

                                                    practical use as well as decorative.
                                                    From being used for daily use and home décor items, terracotta came
                                                    to be used for making temples in 15th – 16th century AD in Bengal.
                                                    The popularity
                                                    of this building material lay in its universal and abundant
                                                    availability across regions. Once people learned to bake the clay,
                                                    they had a way of giving
                                                    permanence to the items created by them. Slowly, terracotta art was
                                                    put to more ambitious uses, such as, creating buildings, sometimes
                                                    replacing stone and
                                                    wood carvings, due to their non-availability.
