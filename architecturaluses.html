                                            Architectural terracotta is an ancient form of masonry that is used
                                            extensively even till today. Indian terracotta manufacturers used to hand
                                            press, pour, and double-mould the clay mix. Plaster casts have been
                                            found around several ancient sites in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India and
                                            Pakistan. Bhitargaon temple and the Jain temple in the Mahbubnagar
                                            district are some examples of ancient terracotta use in architecture.
                                            Because of the similarities in motifs and manufacturing process, scholars
                                            have noted cross cultural pollination between the Hellenic and Indus
                                            River Valley sculptural terracotta traditions.<br><br>Chinese, Korean, and Japanese terracotta-making traditions were focused
                                            on non-architectural uses such as statuary or cookware but various forms
                                            of terracotta tiles were popular roofing materials. During the 1860s in
                                            England and the 1870s in America, architects began using unglazed
                                            terracotta to decorate the exterior surfaces of buildings. It was used on a
                                            number of buildings in Birmingham; on the elaborate terracotta facade
                                            of the Natural History Museum, in London; the Victoria and Albert
                                            Museum (1859–71); and the Royal Albert Hall (1867–71). Earlier, in
                                            1842-45, St Stephen and All Martyrs’ Church, at Lever Bridge in Bolton
                                            had been built almost entirely from terracotta. Curiously, terracotta
                                            received approval as a building material from the Arts and Crafts
                                            movement, since it was deemed to be a handmade material, designed
                                            by craftsmen. In America, the Chicago School of architecture was an
                                            early convert to terracotta. The architect Louis Sullivan (1856-1924), for
                                            instance, was noted for his elaborate glazed terracotta decorations, that
                                            would have been extremely difficult to produce in any other medium.
                                            Fired clay was also used by Chicago designers Daniel Hudson Burnham
                                            (1846-1912) and John Root (1850-91) in the curtain walls of their
                                            Reliance Building (1895), and by William Le Baron Jenney who pioneered
                                            its use in skyscrapers as a way of reducing the risk of fire.<br><br>Terracotta can be used both on the exteriors and interiors either
                                            structurally or non-structurally in the construction of chimneys, bricks,
                                            copings, planters, water pipes, roofing tiles, shingles, architectural details
                                            and other ornaments. It has poor resistance to tension and low shear
                                            strength but is strong in compression. The performance of terracotta in affected by its porosity. It can fail due to a number of reasons like poor
                                            manufacturing or installation (can be due to improper loading, or the mortar
                                            being used being too strong, which puts stress to the terracotta block),
                                            weathering, atmospheric pollution which causes salt formation, freeze-thaw
                                            cycling etc. By the 1920s, a process known as mechanised extrusion was
                                            capable of mass-producing terracotta blocks in standard form for roofing,
                                            flooring and cladding. Although it couldn’t compete with the modern building
                                            materials like concrete and steel. Minimalism and Modernist architecture
                                            too, caused its declined use throughout the 1930’s because of the changing
                                            aesthetic preferences.<br><br>The individual but repetitive nature of the fabrication process made terracotta
                                            construction much more economical than carved stone for elaborate building
                                            exteriors. Terracotta bricks are an essential part of the majestic structures like
                                            the Great Chinese Wall, the Haghia Sophia, or the dome of the Cathedral in
                                            Florence, Italy. Therefore, their use in modern architecture is a revival of this
                                            age old building technique. It does not come as a surprise that architects who
                                            prefer green architecture perceive terracotta as the ideal material for facades
                                            in public buildings since it does not require maintenance, it’s ecological,
                                            inexpensive, sustainable and offers great potential in terms of design.

                                            the school building with the lopsided vaulted roofs in the shape of a child’s doodles is made entirely of terracotta. “The design of the new school grew
                                            organically as a series of classrooms that dance their way through the trees, encountering alcoves, cracks and crevices, projections, niches, inhabited bridges,
                                            boxes and mezzanines,” said the architects. The buildings of the school are surrounded completely the tobacco fields near the town of Bhadran in Gujarat
                                            where the school is located. The whole school was slowly formed in parts as separate modules that were attached to each other with a long corridor creating

                                                that have planted courtyards in their centre. The Sanuki Daisuke Architects came up with a screen of decorative terracotta clockwork in the front of these
                                                buildings, due to the relatively low cost of terracotta as a decorative material used in architecture. These blocks are perforated and hence give natural
