                                            Terracotta products are usually made from a fairly course, porous type of clay.
                                            The rich red and orange colour of this clay makes it one of the most distinct
                                            types of clay one could find. The reason that terracotta has a distinct colour is
                                            because of the iron content in terracotta clay body which reacts with oxygen
                                            and gives it a hue which ranges from reds and oranges yellows and even pinks.
                                            Terracotta has lots of properties which makes it extremely desirable to use.<br><br>
                                            <b>1) Porous in Nature-</b>  One of the most important properties of terracotta
                                            is that it is porous. When terracotta clay is baked at high temperatures, the
                                            clay becomes porous. Due to this property, Terracotta is the perfect choice for
                                            planting trees as it allows proper air circulation. Additionally, Terracotta is used
                                            to make pots and kitchen utensils because the nutritional value of the food
                                            stored inside them remains intact and the food is full of aroma.<br>
                                            <b>2) Strong-</b> Terracotta is an earthy material but is stronger and more robust
                                            than other earthy materials like clay as it is baked for such a long time in fire.
                                            The firing process makes it very firm and strong so that it can be used as a
                                            utensil to cook as well as a material in building structures.<br>
                                            <b>3) Fire resistant-</b> This is another important property of terracotta. Being fire
                                            resistant, most of the fire accidents can be prevented if terracotta tiles have
                                            been used while building homes.<br>
                                            <b>4) Easy to clean-</b>  Terracotta can be cleaned very easily. It can be easily
                                            brushed off with warm water, soft cloth or a brush. A mild detergent can also be
                                            used to remove terracotta spots/ stains.<br>
                                            <b>5) Insulating properties-</b>  Terracotta can survive extreme weather conditions.
                                            It it works as an insulator and is used in roofing to keep the homes hot during
                                            the cold weather conditions. It can also be used to store food to keep it warm.
                                            <br>
                                            <b>6) Ecological material-</b> Terracotta is completely made of renewable and
                                            Earthy components which makes it completely environment-friendly. It is
                                            not made from any hazardous chemicals nor does it release any gases while
                                            decomposing and is entirely organic. To add to this, terracotta is recyclable as
                                            well.<br>
                                            <b>7) Glazed Terracotta-</b> Terracotta products can also be made
                                            waterproof by glazing. Terracotta has pores in it but glaze can fill these
                                            pores.<br>
                                            <b>8) Multiple uses-</b>  From roofing material to kitchenware, terracotta
                                            has numerous applications. It can be used in building structures and is
                                            also a good choice for storing food. It is used as a gardening pot to plant
                                            trees and small plants. Also used in making religious sculptures and show

                                            <b>Terracotta Moulds</b>  A huge range of terracotta products require the usage of moulds, as sometimes, it is too time consuming and even impossible for
                                            them to put as many small details into each piece as they require, especially when sculpting figurines or embellishments over a product.
                                            A mould is prepared by first creating a master idol piece with as many facial details/ features with proper measurements. Reference designs of the idol are
                                            taken from sources like photos, books, Internet, calendars or newspapers. The mould is 2inch thick and consists of two parts to form one idol.
                                            Once the idol is prepared, a flat strip of clay is joined to the idol to hold the mould paste. Solution of Grease and Kerosene is applied on the idol so that the
                                            mould mixture doesn’t dominate the design. The mould is divided in three layers.<br>
                                            In the first layer mixture, dental casting powder is used. This casting powder is used to get detail impressions of the idol in the mould. After the first layer is
                                            dried, mixture of twenty percent of cement and seventy percent of POP (Plaster of Paris) and ten percent of dental casting powder is applied. On the last
                                            layer coconut fibre is dipped in the mixture of cement and POP powder is applied.<br>
                                            After the mould is dried to an extent, the supportive clay strip is removed using a knife. The same method is repeated to prepare the other side of the
                                            mould. Before making the other side of the mould a thin layer of soap is applied on the edges of the one side finished mould, so that the either side of the
                                            mould doesn’t stick to each other. The prepared mould is kept in room temperature to dry almost for a week.<br><br>
