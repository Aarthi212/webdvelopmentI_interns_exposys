                                            Terra-cotta (Italian: “baked earth” from the Latin <i>terra cocta</i>) is a
                                            clay-based
                                            unglazed ceramic. It has been used throughout history for sculpture and
                                            pottery, as well as bricks and roof shingles.
                                        </p><br>

                                        <p class="text-primary card-text-1">
                                            The term is also used to refer to items made out of this material and to its
                                            natural, brownish orange color. For more than ten thousand years man has
                                            expressed his feelings and his aesthetic in clay. According to myth, it was
                                            an
                                            accidental fire which provided the knowledge that clay hardened on ring.
                                        </p><br>

                                        <p class="text-primary card-text-1">
                                            Terracotta is one of the most distinct types of clay you’ll find, given its
                                            rich,
                                            rust red/orange coloring. The reason for this distinct color is that the
                                            iron
                                            content in terracotta’s clay body reacts with oxygen and gives it a hue that
                                            ranges through reds, oranges, yellows, and even pinks.
                                        </p><br>

                                        <p class="text-primary card-text-1">
                                            Terracotta clay is easy to sculpt into all sorts of shapes. Once shaped,
                                            it’s
                                            heated to 1,000-2,000° F to harden. Then, a simple coat of glaze can make
                                            terracotta watertight.
                                        </p><br>

                                        <p class="text-primary card-text-1">
                                            The properties of terracotta are that it’s a porous clay to work with, and
                                            it
                                            can also be used glazed and unglazed, which adds to its appeal. One coat of
                                            glaze is needed to make it waterproof. When terracotta is glazed, bright
                                            colors
                                            are often favored because they work brilliantly with terracotta’s low-firing
                                            temperature (approximately 1100 C/2012 F to 1200 C/2192 F to create a
                                            striking contrast with its orange body). These low firing temperatures also
                                            mean lower energy costs. In some cases, terracotta has been fired as low as
                                            600
                                            degrees Celsius. Majolica ware can be created with terracotta by

                                            them again. Sometimes, nothing more than a clear glaze needs to be used on
                                            terracotta to enhance its natural fired color and give it a great shine.

                                            Terracotta has been around for a long time. In fact, it was the only clay
                                            product used until around the 14th century. Archeologists have found
                                            terracotta sculptures that are 5,000 years old!

                                            One of its earliest reference points was in prehistoric art, with some
                                            of the oldest pottery of time being found as far back as 24,000 BC.
                                            Interestingly, these early pieces were found to be Palaeolithic terracotta
                                            figurines, rather than cooking vessels, as you might expect, demonstrating
                                            how widely terracotta has been used in the art. Perhaps, terracotta’s most
                                            famous use in art was China’s Terracotta Army, which is a magnificent
                                            collection of terracotta figures of over 8,000 soldiers and 520 horses.
                                            It was found in the First Emperor of China, Emperor <i>Qin Shi Huang's</i>
                                            mausoleum (246 to 208 BCE, but not discovered until 1974 by local
                                            Chinese farmers). Terracotta is widely preferred for sculpture, given
                                            its thick and malleable texture and eases to be molded. It’s a far easier
                                            material to work with than say marble or bronze. Terracotta also has a
                                            close link to architecture, most commonly in roof tiles and brickwork, as
                                            it’s incredibly durable, beautiful in color and one of the cheapest clays to
                                            work with.

                                            Terracotta is usually reddish or brown in colour and is considered to be
                                            the first ingenious expression of civilization. The making of terracotta
                                            pottery is no ordinary process. Each terracotta pot or piece of art is

                                            taken to make such a masterpiece is what makes terracotta so valuable
