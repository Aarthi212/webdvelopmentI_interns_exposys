                                            The terracotta craft is widespread across India with certain cities and states having a distinct terracotta-ware industry. The contrast in sensibilities of the
                                            artisans, the varied culture and the religious practices and traditions from region to region provide for the unique firing and making processes followed in
                                            different regions. The making process involves different stages such as clay refining, clay mixing, throwing on the wheel, drying and firing.
                                            <br><br>
                                            <b>Main Process:</b><br><br>The first and foremost step is the refining and mixing of the clay. The raw
                                            clay needs to be refined before it is made into terracotta pots, tiles or other
                                            products.<br>
                                            Initially the clay is refined by removing the dust particles and other impurities.
                                            This is done by first drying the clay and then screening and filtering it so that
                                            impurities are removed.This is done manually using fine nets to filter the dry
                                            clay. After this, a dough consisting of raw materials such as sand (isuka) and
                                            clay (maati) with water is prepared. The craftsmen then mix this dough by
                                            stamping and crushing it. This ensures better mixing of the clay.<br>After the clay is prepared, Terracotta products can be formed by either of the
                                            three different ways mentioned below:<br>
                                            <b>1) Handmade-</b>The first method is to give the desired shape and form by
                                            hand. Larger shapes are made with help of the palm and thumb while smaller
                                            shapes and fine retouching is done with the help of sticks or tools.<br>
                                            <b>2) Dice or Mould made-</b>If the particular form is to be made at a larger
                                            scale, then moulds or dices are used and the final finishing is done by hand.
                                            Moulds made with either plaster of Paris, clay or terracotta are used. Before
                                            using the mould, it is first beaten (pitna) so that dust and unwanted particles
                                            are removed. Then some extra sand is sprinkled on it. Finally a thick coating
                                            of the prepared clay is put in the mould and it is beaten again to get the
                                            desired shape.<br>
                                            <b>3) Wheel made-</b>This is known as the throwing process which is done on
                                            the potter’s wheel. The clay mixture is placed on the centre of the wheel
                                            and the wheel is rotated with a bamboo stick. As the wheel rotates, the
                                            craftsman starts shaping the clay into the desired shape or form. After the
                                            desired shape is achieved, the potter smoothens the outer surface with a
                                            wet cloth. The motifs and patterns on the products is done by using a shop
                                            edged metal piece<br>After the clay is moulded into the desired shape with the desired method,
                                            it is kept in the sun for drying for 2 to 3 days. The object is not dried for

                                            process. The terracotta needs to be fired in order to cook and harden.
                                            The firing is done in the Bhatti- traditional open furnace within a circular
                                            area. The product is kept carefully and is covered by locally available fuel
                                            such as dry coconut leaves, small wooden pieces. The kiln is covered with
                                            mud and fired to produce an extremely high temperature.<br>
                                            The objects, after firing, turn into two different colours such as red and
                                            black. The red colour is obtained when the smoke comes out through the
                                            vents of the kiln. Where in the black colour is obtained by covering the
                                            vents completely without allowing the smoke to come out. The objects/
                                            products after firing are tested and segregated by separating the good
                                            quality pieces and the damaged ones.

                                                    The terracotta craft is widespread across India with certain cities and states having a distinct Terracotta ware industry. The contrast in sensibilities of the
                                                    artisans, the varied culture and the religious practices and traditions from region to region provide for the unique firing and making processes followed in
                                                    different regions. The making process involves different stages such as clay refining, clay mixing, throwing on the wheel, drying and firing

                                                    The trends in their terracotta work are mostly traditional or community related motifs. In this area, the fuel used for firing is firewood,
                                                    dry leaves and twigs, all locally sourced. At temperatures of 700°- 800 °C, the moulded products are baked in traditional kilns.
                                                    Women operate the pottery wheel and they are responsible for shaping the upper structure of the pots made.

                                                    <b>Tamil Nadu:  </b>Tamil Nadu potters are referred to as Kuyavar or Velar. They trace their origins to Vishwakarma, the heavenly master craftsman. Tamil Nadu is famous
                                                    for the production of large terracotta horses.
                                                    The custom of having a large terracotta horse figure guarding its entrance is followed by many villages in this state. This horse is Aiyyanar’s compan
                                                    ion, the Deity of the Tamil Village.<br>
                                                    Statues of this deity are sometimes discovered accompanied by a terracotta horse, usually with Aiyannar seated upon them. These statues are prepared by
                                                    mixing sand and straw to clay to get a certain consistency and wood pieces covered in clay are used for legs. The rest of the ceramic pieces including the
                                                    head and the accessories are separately created. These pieces are then joined on an auspicious day and fired in a straw and cow dung kiln covered with
                                                    mud. In recent times, artisans have shifted to using moulds for creating these horses given their popularity and demand.<br>
                                                    <br><br><b>Odisha:  </b>Some of India’s finest terracotta work comes from Odisha. The craft is primarily performed by village tribes. Artists prepare items and highlight them in
                                                    color, but often leave them in their normal terracotta color.
                                                    In western parts of Odisha, potters adopt the open fire method, using more wood for firing the kiln and make red or reddish-yellow items. Animal figures
                                                    of horses, elephants and bulls are also elegantly molded in very natural, solid shapes. Orissa potters also produce earthen pots to be used in certain religious
                                                    rituals. They are made in a range of shapes and styles. The goods vary from household to decorative ones such as pans, pitchers, diyas, cups, incense
                                                    burners, necklace sets, bracelets, masks, dolls, candlesticks and many more. The clay used in this area is combined with fresh and sun-dried raw materials
                                                    so that before further processing moisture is taken out of the clay. The fuel for the furnace used is cow dung cake, rice straw, husk and little plant material
                                                    collected from the local area. It is also found that male members play a major role in this phase while men and women are engaged in pottery making.
                                                    It is worth noting that males exclusively participate in wheel operations that involve more physical labor, experience, knowledge and tenacity in order to
                                                    produce various pottery products. The female helps males in all possible stages of pottery development, of course. Unlike in some pottery community, both

                                                    A sheet is made of a dome-shaped top part to render idols and the edges are raised for a bottom. The idols are positioned in the center of the surface and
                                                    shaped as desired with a hollow structure.
                                                    To make idols, a slab is made with a dome-shaped upper part and the edges are lifted to form a rim. The idols are placed in the centre of the slab and
                                                    shaped in the desired form with hollow structure so that the idols do not burst in the furnace. After this, the idols are decorated with clay beads.
                                                    Figurines are made through techniques like pinching, rolling, Pressing, and squeezing. When the plaques are ready, they are dried in the furnace for nine
